 QNG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Since China’s division in 1644, the Qing has hoped to eliminate the Southern Ming. In the last war the Qing joined Germany, but they suffered a humiliating defeat and lost many things. After the war, the Qing were bordering on danger, the domestic Han Nationalists began to stir, but the Qing Emperor was a weak yes-man. \n\nFortunately, the Great Depression made their southern neighbors too weak to attack. After rearming, the Qing Army was once again at full strength. So NOW may be the time to resolve domestic issues and take the south."
